	\section{Critical Thinking Question(20pts)}
	
	Answer each question using complete sentences. You may choose to include sketches and/or examples to enchance your explanations. Your written answers must be typed. Sketches may be hand drawn. if you prefer not to build a complete document, I recomend using Microsoft World's built-in equation editon or use a equation editor such as the one found at \texttt{http:www.stimo.com/latex} as needed
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Describe a real-world situation that could be represented by the equation $a=b+3$. Include a definition for each variable.
	\item Explain the difference between $-3^2$ and $(-3)^2$ in terms of order of operations.
	\item Desribe the relationships betwees natural, whole,integer, rational, irrational and real numbers. Give one example and one non-example of each.
